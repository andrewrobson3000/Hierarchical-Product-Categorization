# Hierarchical-Product-Categorization

## Project Overview
This repository contains a Python-based solution for automating product categorization into hierarchical levels. Utilizing a combination of data preprocessing, feature extraction, and machine learning techniques, this project aims to efficiently classify products based on their descriptions into multiple category levels.

## Dataset
The project utilizes the `product-cat-dataset.csv` file, which is crucial for the categorization process. This dataset includes product descriptions alongside their assigned categories across three hierarchical levels. It serves as the foundation for training and evaluating the machine learning models implemented in this project.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Implements custom preprocessing to clean and prepare product description data.
- **Feature Extraction**: Uses TF-IDF to transform textual descriptions into a feature matrix.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Employs Decision Tree Classifiers and Gaussian Naive Bayes for categorizing products into three hierarchical levels.
- **Model Evaluation**: Applies accuracy metrics to assess the performance of the classification models at each level.

## Setup and Installation
